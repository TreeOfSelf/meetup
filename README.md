# Meetup

Meetup is a virtual hangout space, where you can chat with strangers, or in a group with friends. It uses WebRTC for fast, high-quality video streaming. You can share your screen, your webcam, specific windows.
Draw on a synced whiteboard with different colors, and watch Youtube together!

Imagine Omegle, but less degenerate, it's about actually conncecting with people and having a great time.
